                    The National Environment Agency (NEA) is the leading public organisation responsible for ensuring a
                    clean and sustainable environment for Singapore. Its key roles are to improve and sustain a clean
                    environment, promote sustainability and resource efficiency, maintain high public health standards,
                    provide timely and reliable meteorological information, and encourage a vibrant hawker culture.

                    NEA works closely with its partners and the community to develop and spearhead environmental and
                    public health initiatives and programmes. It is committed to motivating every individual to care for
                    the environment as a way of life, in order to build a liveable and sustainable Singapore for present
                    and future generations. <br><br>NEA introduced a regulated e-waste management system in July 2021 to
                    ensure the proper collection and handling of e-waste and the extraction of valuable resources from
                    e-waste. The regulated e-waste management system also safeguards the environment and our health. The
                    regulated e-waste management system is based on the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) approach,
                    where producers bear the responsibility for the collection and treatment of their products when they
                    reach end-of-life. For more information on the regulated e-waste management system, please visit

                    With the expansion of our clientele and scope of our operations, we introduced our first Materials
